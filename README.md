Besides being large, the web also evolves constantly. Therefore, this project has a long way to go. The guide's content is in the folder [source/guia](https://github.com/fernahh/frontendpath/tree/master/source/guia).

Soon I will open issues for collaboration.

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my_feature`
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin my_feature`
4. Submit a pull request!
